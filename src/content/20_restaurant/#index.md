We work closely with a variety of local suppliers to bring you the best seasonal Scottish Highland produce, as well as our own homegrown produce from our gardens. As such, our menu changes daily reflecting the season and availability.

Your menu can be prepared fully gluten free or dairy free on request and we are able to accommodate many other dietary requirements. Please let us know when booking or on arrival and we will do our best to accommodate your specific needs.

We will always have a fully vegan extended menu option available on request, again changing regularly. A small children's menu is also available.

## The Best in Scottish Dining

Scotland has a wealth of fresh seafood, wild meats, and foraged flavours to bring food to life.

We cater for gluten-free, lactose/dairy-free, vegan, and vegetarian diets. If you have any other dietary requirements, please let us know in advance and we will be happy to cater for you.

A selection of Scots Whisky, ales, beers, wines, cocktails, and other drinks are available in the lounge area before dinner. A full wine list is provided to compliment your meal.
